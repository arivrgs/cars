# Contributing to Cars
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create a branch `your-name-dev`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Run the tests using `make node-test`.
4. Open that pull request!

## Request features and report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/samuelrey/cars/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track new features and bugs. [Open a new issue](); it's that easy! It also makes for a great way to communicate progress and roadblocks.

## Write bug reports
Follow these guidelines:

- A quick summary and/or background.
- Steps to reproduce.
    - Start from scratch (e.g. _“1. Create a new document, 2. Change language to Ruby, 3. …”_).
	- Explicitly mention every action involved, and how you invoked it (e.g., rather than _“delete the text”_, say _“Select Cut from the Edit menu”_ or  _“Press <kbd>⌘X</kbd>”_).
	- Keep the number of steps to a minimum.
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, stuff you tried that didn't work or even screenshots)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
